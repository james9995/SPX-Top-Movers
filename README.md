# SPX-Top-Movers
Just a bit of code I wrote in an afternoon to demonstrate some things I know in Python 

Code to:
1) Scrape S&P 100 constituent tickers from Wikipedia
2) Use pandas Datareader to get recent price moves 
3) Create and send an email with the absoute top 10 greatest moves for the last trading day

Obvioulsly I could develop further to add some plots and format the html to look nicer.
